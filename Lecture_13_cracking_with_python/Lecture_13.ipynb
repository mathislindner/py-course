    "Because of the Corona virus outbreak, this lecture will not be held in the classroom but online only. Further, the lecture will only be available in this written form. In order to offer support for the students we will use the gitlab issue tracker as a question & answer forum: https://git.ee.ethz.ch/python-for-engineers/class-fs20-forum and individual videoconference sessions when needed.\n",

    "Please install the following tools:\n",
    "* python3 (https://www.python.org/downloads/ version 3.8.2 is fine.\n",
    "Python is a prerequisite for jupyter)\n",
    "* jupyter-notebook (https://jupyter.org/install.html)\n",

    "\n",
    "Quoting Richard Stallman, \"*it is hard to write a simple definition of something as varied as hacking, but I think what these activities have in common is playfulness, cleverness, and exploration. Thus, hacking means exploring the limits of what is possible, in a spirit of playful cleverness. Activities that display playful cleverness have \"hack value\".*\" https://stallman.org/articles/on-hacking.html.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to this definition, using three chopsticks instead of two for having fun during a dinner would be a form of *hacking* for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quoting again https://stallman.org/articles/on-hacking.html: \"*Around 1980, when the news media took notice of hackers, they fixated on one narrow aspect of real hacking: the security breaking which some hackers occasionally did. They ignored all the rest of hacking, and took the term to mean breaking security, no more and no less. The media have since spread that definition, disregarding our attempts to correct them. As a result, most people have a mistaken idea of what we hackers actually do and what we think.*\" \n",
    "\n",
    "The Cambridge Dictionary reports a definition not too far from the one of Stallman:\n",
    "\n",
    "**hacker:** *a person who is skilled in the use of computer systems, often one who illegally obtains access to private computer systems* https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/hacker\n",
    "\n",
    "While the [fake?] Oxford *living* dictionary reports just the narrow meaning of security breaking: \n",
    "\n",
    "**hacking:** *the gaining of unauthorized access to data in a system or computer.* https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/hacking\n",
    "\n",
    "Quoting again Stallman: \"*You can help correct the misunderstanding simply by making a distinction between security breaking and hackingâ€”by using the term \"cracking\" for security breaking. The people who do it are \"crackers\". Some of them may also be hackers, just as some of them may be chess players or golfers; most of them are not.*\""
