    "## Introduction - Non-preemptive multitasking\n",
    "\n",
    "This lecture introduces *multitasking* in Python with the `async/await` syntax. Generally, multitasking is understood as the concurrent execution of tasks or programs. This means that multiple programms or functions can be running at the same time. Tasks can run truely parallel on multiple CPU cores or they can also share computation time on a single core. If multiple tasks run on the same CPU core then the CPU time must be split among the tasks. This means that tasks must sometimes be interrupted to let other tasks use the CPU. Multitasking can be roughly split into two classes depending on how tasks can be interrupted, *preemptive* and *non-preemtive* multitasking:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) *Preemptive* means that a task can be paused by the operating system for a *context switch*, i.e. to free the CPU for another task to run. Tasks themselves have little control over where in their code they can be paused. Preemptive multitasking is often implemented with *threads*.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) On the other hand in *non-preemptive* multitasking tasks explicitly tell when they want to be paused. For this reason non-preemptive multitasking is often called *cooperative* multitasking. Further, names like 'coroutines' or 'fibers' can be encountered.\n",
    "Cooperative multitasking usually has less overhead than operating-system threads. Context switches are faster for cooperative multithreading and tasks have less memory overhead. This makes cooperative multitasking very well suited for highly concurrent and *I/O-bound* applications such as networking where thousands of connections must be handled at the same time. *I/O-bound* means that a program is often busy waiting for data to arrive or to be sent while the CPU is idle and could be used to work on another task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quoting Wikipedia: \"*In computing, preemption is the act of temporarily interrupting a task being carried out by a computer system, without requiring its cooperation, and with the intention of resuming the task at a later time.*\" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preemption_(computing)\n",
    "\n",
    "## `async/await` Syntax\n",
    "With version 3.5 Python introduced the `async/await` syntax to write *coroutines*. Coroutines can be thought of as functions that can be suspended and resumed. Therefore their execution is not necessarily synchronous but *asynchronous* and hence they are defined with `async def`. This means once an `async` function or *coroutine* does not return immediately but somewhen later such that other code can be run between the start and end of the coroutine. Notice that coroutines behave similarly to *generators*. The `await` keyword is used to explicitly  wait for completion of a coroutine.\n",

    "In other words, an *event loop* is a program that manages the scheduling of tasks and coroutines. When a coroutine is paused because it calls `await` then the control goes back to the event loop which will decide which task to execute next. As the name suggests the *event loop* handles *events* such as an elapsed timer or arriving network packets. Upon such an event the *event loop* resumes tasks that are waiting for this event. The `asyncio` library implements an event loop. There are also other event loop implementations around such as [`uvloop`](https://uvloop.readthedocs.io/).\n",

    "When sending and receiving data through the internet or local networks data is packaged into *IP* (*Internet Protocol*) packets. IP packets bundle a data fragment together with a source and destination address to tell the network where to bring the packet. From an application viewpoint IP packets are rarely used directly, instead further layers of abstraction are used. In practice this is very often *TCP* (*Transmission Control Protocol*) or *UDP* (*User Datagram Protocol*). Both of the protocols use IP packets but they add something on top.\n",

All this cases must be handled by the application.\n",
