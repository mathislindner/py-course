# Python

* General information & lecture dates: [General_Information_Sheet_FS20.pdf](./General_Information_Sheet_FS20.pdf)
* Materials: The class material comprises slides and python exercises. These are provided via a Git repository.
* Passing: Credits for this P&S are awarded to all students who seriously worked on all provided exercises and made them available by uploading them to their personal fork of the class Git repository. The goal is that students learn programming, and this is only done with exercising programming.

## Lecture 1
The first lecture is an introduction into software used for the upcoming lectures. This includes:

* GNU/Linux, Debian (operating system used on the P&S PCs)
* GNOME Desktop (the default graphical user interface of Debian)
* Terminal (also known as 'shell' or 'command-line'. Here we use an implementation called 'bash')
* git (tool for source-code management such as keeping track of changes and versions, exchanging code with others)
* A 'hello world' program in Python

The lecture slides are in the [Lecture_01_introduction](./Lecture_01_introduction) folder and can be downloaded as a PDF.

## Lecture 3 - Python Introduction Part 2

**NEW**: Those working from home can now ask questions on the issue tracker [here](https://git.ee.ethz.ch/python-for-engineers/class-fs20-forum/issues).

This lecture will cover:

* Style guide
* Functions (in more depth) 
* Modules
* Error handling
* Local and global variables


**Preparation**: Download the new lecture material by executing the following in the terminal:

```bash
cd ~/class-fs20 # Change to the git directory.
git pull upstream master # Download the latest lecture material.
```

If git is not available on your system (working from home), download the material from [here](https://git.ee.ethz.ch/python-for-engineers/class-fs20/-/archive/master/class-fs20-master.zip) and unpack it on your computer.

* This class uses no slides, but only jupyter-notebooks. Next, please open the file Lecture_3.ipynb.
