    "Because of the Corona virus outbreak, this lecture will not be held in the classroom but online only. Further, the lecture will only be available in this written form. In order to offer support for the students we will use the gitlab issue tracker as a question & answer forum: https://git.ee.ethz.ch/python-for-engineers/class-fs20-forum.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Software\n",
    "\n",
    "### Necessary software\n",
    "Please install the following tools:\n",
    "* python3 (https://www.python.org/downloads/ version 3.8.2 is fine.\n",
    "Python is a prerequisite for jupyter)\n",
    "* jupyter-notebook (https://jupyter.org/install.html)\n",
    "* **Hint for Windows and OSX**: Try to install conda or miniconda (https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) first. This will install Python and jupyter-notebook automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optional (but highly recommended) software\n",
    "* git (https://git-scm.com/download/). Git is harder to install but not strictly necessary. **Hint**: On Windows Git will automatically install a Linux compatible shell which can then be found as 'Git BASH'.\n",

    "The **first class** are implementation flaws or errors in the code such as a function being called with wrong argument types. This type of errors can be attributed to the programmers. In this cases correct error handling is difficult because the code is not correct. Often, the only way to reasonably deal with this is to abort the program and fix the code. `assert` statements are a good way to detect this type of errors. As in the example above it makes often sense to check function arguments for the types or check that some value is not `None`.\n",

    "So far, this course introduced three container data types: `list`, `dict` and `tuple`. *Container* or *collection* data types hold data in a structured way. Each of the container types has its advantages and disadvantages. A list, for instance, provides a memory-efficient way to store many elements and offers constant-time access to elements when addressing them by the offset in the list. Membership tests, however, are very inefficient for lists: To test if a certain element is in the list, in fact, the whole list has to be searched in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is another built-in container data type in Python: `set`. A set in Python behaves very similar to sets in the mathematical sense. In contrast to a list, a set does not define an ordering of the elements nor allows an element to be in the set more than once.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Observation**: in the background, however, Python usually stores the elements of the sets in and ordered fascion (using hash tables), but this ordering is not exposed to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "A set behaves very similar to a dictionary with *keys* but without *values*. Moreover, the syntax to create sets is very similar to the one for dictionaries:"

Key and value can depend on `e` but don't have to. As with list comprehensions it is possible to conditionally create a dictionary entry. The condition can depend on `e`.\n",
