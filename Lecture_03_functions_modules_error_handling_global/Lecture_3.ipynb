    "# Style guide\n",
    "\n",
    "Some prominent Python developers, such as the original Python creator Guido van Rossum, defined the following \"Style Guide for Python Code\":\n",

    "## Spaces vs. tabs for indentations\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already seen that *indentations* have a precise meaning in the Python syntax. In the past however, people used inconsistently tabs or spaces across their projects. Even when using spaces, and indentation could be defined by using a different number of spaces, therefore increasing confusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the PEP recommendations: **Spaces are the preferred indentation method.** Use **four** spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tabs should be used solely to remain consistent with code that is already indented with tabs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 3 disallows mixing the use of tabs and spaces for indentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 2 code indented with a mixture of tabs and spaces should be converted to using spaces exclusively.\n",
    "\n",
    "When invoking the Python 2 command line interpreter with the -t option, it issues warnings about code that illegally mixes tabs and spaces. When using -tt these warnings become errors. These options are highly recommended!\n",

    "## Naming conventions\n",
    "In principle, everybody can use any notation he wishes. However, a unified and consistent nomenclature helps exchaning code and improves readability of programs written by others. \n",

    "The PEP 8 naming convention are accessible at:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#prescriptive-naming-conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "According to these conventions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Modules** (defined later in this lecture) should have **short, all-lowercase** names. Underscores can be used in the module name if it improves readability. \n",
    "* Python **packages** should also have **short, all-lowercase names**, although the use of underscores is discouraged. Exception: When an extension module written in C or C++ has an accompanying Python module that provides a higher level (e.g. more object oriented) interface, the C/C++ module has a leading underscore (e.g. _socket).\n",
    "* **Class names** should normally use the **CapWords** convention. The naming convention for functions may be used instead in cases where the interface is documented and used primarily as a callable. Note that there is a separate convention for built-in names: most built-in names are single words (or two words run together), with the CapWords convention used only for exception names and built-in constants. \n",
    "* Because exceptions should be classes, the class naming convention applies here. However, you should use the suffix \"Error\" on your exception names (if the exception actually is an error).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Function names** should be **lowercase, with words separated by underscores** as necessary to improve readability.\n",
    "* **Variable names** follow the same convention **as function names**.\n",
    "* **Constants** are usually defined on a module level and written in **all capital letters with underscores** separating words. Examples include MAX_OVERFLOW and TOTAL.\n",

This is the so called \"*docstring*\" of the function and it documents its functionality. *There are tools which automatically compile the docstrings* to e.g. a browseable documentation website.
