    "# Object-oriented programming in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is object-oriented programming (OOP)?\n",
    "OOP is a way of programming based on the concept of *objects*. Usually *objects* bundle together data, so-called *attributes*. *Objects* can also be associated with code, so-called *methods*. In Python, *objects* are instances of a *class* wich defines the structure of the *objects*. *Class*es can be thought-of as construction plans or blueprints for *objects*.\n",
    "OOP is particularly useful in large programming projects since it facilitates maintating and/or extending them.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several languages utilizing the concept of *objects*. In most programming languages, these *objects* are based on *classes* and on their *instantiations*. In other languages, such as JavaScript, the objects consist of *prototypes* instead of *classes*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Object-oriented programming vs. NON object-oriented programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Fundamentally, the difference between OOP and non-OOP is that in OOP there are more complex *data types* (which are called *classes*) than just the fundamental data types (such as integer, float or string). This more complex data types not only bundle other data types but also code, such as functions. This leads to a fundamentally different approach of programmers towards a given problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "* In OOP, when a programmer is given a problem to solve, he will start *first* to think which *data types* (or *objects*) best describe his problem and only *afterwards* he will think about which *relation* there is between these new data types. For example, if a programmer must write a program for a health insurance which determines the price of the insurance policy, the programmer will possibly first define the class *patient* which contains properties like age, height, previous health conditions, and later determine the algorithm, or the relation between the class *patient* and the insurance cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In non-OOP, instead, there are no such new data types (or classes), but just the *fundamental* data types (like integer or float). The programmer therefore will immediately focus on what is the relationship between all the different *fundamental* data types which describe the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP also comes with new concepts such as *inheritance* and *polymorphism*. For non-OOP the usual relation between data types is *combination*: Data types can hold other data types. For example a `Forest` contains `Animals`. However, *inheritance* (also called *sub-typing*) is another type of relation between data types: It is a hierarchical relation, which allows to build abstraction. For example one could write a general class `Animal` and create a sub-type `Cat`. This reflects the fact that a `Cat` *is* an `Animal`. `Animal` is called the *super-class* of `Cat` and `Cat` is called *sub-class* of `Animal`. This allows to write more abstract code that for example cares only about `Animals` and does not have to distinguish between `Cat`s, `Bird`s etcetera.\n",
    "*Polymorphism* refers to the concept that code can be agnostic whether it deals with `Cat`s or `Bird`s as long as they are `Animal`s."

    "## Classes\n",
    "An *object* is an *instance* of a *class*. As mentioned above, *classes* can be imagined as the construction plans or the blueprints of an object. Every object therefore will inherit a number of properties from the class (such as the name of the *attributes* and the *methods*) when such a class is instantiated. For example, if the *class* \"patient\" has the attributes \"age\" and \"height\", and if *Ms. Roth* and *Mr. Braun* are both instances (objects) of the class *patient*, then they both will inherit the attributes \"age\" and \"height\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Observation**: In Python, creating a new *class* does not create a new *object*, but a new *type of object* (or a new *data type*).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Attributes and methods\n",
    "When dealing with classes, *variables* are called *attributes* and *functions* are called *methods*. In other words:\n",
    "* *attributes* are *variables* related to a class, and\n",
    "* *methods* are *functions* related to a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both, *attributes* and *methods*, are called *members* of the class. *Members* can be accessed with the `.` dot operator, for example: `<object_name>.<member_name>`.\n",
