    "Because of the Corona virus outbreak, this lecture will not be held in the classroom but online only. Further, the lecture will only be available in this written form. In order to offer support for the students we will use the gitlab issue tracker as a question & answer forum: https://git.ee.ethz.ch/python-for-engineers/class-fs20-forum and individual videoconference sessions when needed.\n",

    "## Software\n",

    "### Necessary software\n",
    "Please install the following tools:\n",
    "* python3 (https://www.python.org/downloads/ version 3.8.2 is fine.\n",
    "Python is a prerequisite for jupyter)\n",
    "* jupyter-notebook (https://jupyter.org/install.html)\n",
    "* **Hint for Windows and OSX**: Try to install conda or miniconda (https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) first. This will install Python and jupyter-notebook automatically.\n",

    "### Optional (but highly recommended) software\n",

    "When data is sent over the network or written to a file it must be transformed or *serialized* into a sequence of bytes. On the side of the receiver the bytes must be correctly interpreted or *deserialized* to reconstruct the original data. In practice it is often convenient to be able to serialize structured data types such as lists, dicts or even objects. There are a myriad of possible ways to serialize an object.\n",

JSON encodes data as a human-readable string that resembles very strongly the Python syntax. The data types supported by JSON are limited to base types, lists and dicts. Lists and dicts can be nested. The `json` module is an integral part of Python and hence, JSON can easily be used as shown in the following code.\n"
