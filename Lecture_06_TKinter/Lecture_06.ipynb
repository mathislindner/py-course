    "# Notes about this lecture\n",
    "Because of the Corona virus outbreak, this lecture will not be held in the classroom but online only. Further, the lecture will only be available in this written form. In order to offer support for the students we will use the gitlab issue tracker as a question & answer forum: https://git.ee.ethz.ch/python-for-engineers/class-fs20-forum and individual videoconference sessions when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Software\n",
    "\n",
    "### Necessary software\n",
    "Please install the following tools:\n",
    "* python3 (https://www.python.org/downloads/ version 3.8.2 is fine.\n",
    "Python is a prerequisite for jupyter)\n",
    "* jupyter-notebook (https://jupyter.org/install.html)\n",
    "* **Hint for Windows and OSX**: Try to install conda or miniconda (https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) first. This will install Python and jupyter-notebook automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optional (but highly recommended) software\n",
    "* git (https://git-scm.com/download/). Git is harder to install but not strictly necessary. **Hint**: On Windows Git will automatically install a Linux compatible shell which can then be found as 'Git BASH'.\n",
    "* If git is not available, solutions shall be uploaded on https://polybox.ethz.ch instead and the folder shall be shared with the lecturers. \n",

    "## Support\n",
    "**For any issues please use the forum** at: https://git.ee.ethz.ch/python-for-engineers/class-fs20-forum and follow the instructions therein. In case of need, we will open a room on https://jitsi.riot.im/ and share the audio, video or the screen: make sure you have a microphone and speakers functioning. \n",
